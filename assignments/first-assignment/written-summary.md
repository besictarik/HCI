# Scholia

## Problem  
Students often face overloaded, overpriced platforms filled with lengthy courses and scattered learning paths. Finding concise, high-quality lessons that deliver results quickly feels harder than ever.

## Target Users  
Learners and beginners seeking practical, well-structured courses that help them build real skills efficiently.

## Proposed Solution  
**Scholia** is a premium, **Next.js-powered** learning platform offering a curated library of short, project-based courses created and owned by our team.  
Users can explore, purchase, and access their courses through a personal dashboard.  
The platform includes a public **blog powered by Payload CMS**, where we share insights, updates, and learning resources.  
Everything is designed to be **seamless, responsive, and distraction-free**.

## How We Chose It  
We wanted to reimagine online learning from a student’s perspective — focused, elegant, and genuinely useful.  
Scholia keeps only what matters: **clarity, speed, and meaningful progress.**
